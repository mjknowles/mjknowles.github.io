Hello to all the people not reading this blog! I'm going to use this blog as a way to share my experiences while creating my latest application idea. Today I'm learning the basics of Github Pages/Jekyll/Markdown.

Things to remember:
* Run jekyll by navigating to my blog directory and running "jekyll serve --watch"
* Commit to GitHub -
  1. git commit -am "my message"
  2. git push origin master
